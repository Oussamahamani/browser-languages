# Polynet ‚Äî The Internet, in Your Language

Polynet is a Chromium-based Android web browser powered by the Gemma 3n model that translates all internet content ‚Äî text, images, and videos ‚Äî into your native language in real time. It breaks down language barriers, enabling seamless access to the entire web regardless of language.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Full Webpage Translation**: AI-powered on-the-fly translation of text content preserving page structure.
- **Image & Infographic Translation**: OCR-based extraction and overlay translation of text in images.
- **Real-Time Video Dubbing**: On-device text-to-speech dubbing of YouTube videos in multiple languages.
- **Privacy First**: All translation happens on-device to ensure speed and user privacy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

### Project Architecture

Polynet builds on top of **SmartCookieWeb**, an open-source lightweight Chromium-based browser tailored for easy customization and fast prototyping. This foundation allows integration of translation features with minimal overhead.

#### Core Components

- **Gemma 3N 2B model**: Handles all translation tasks for text, images, and video captions on-device.
- **Google ML Kit OCR**: Extracts text and coordinates from images for translation overlays.
- **JavaScript Injection**: Dynamically replaces webpage text and redraws translated content without breaking layout.
- **On-device Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generates dubbed audio for translated video captions.
- **Custom Kotlin/JavaScript Bridge**: Coordinates communication between the Android app and webpage DOM.

### Feature Breakdown

#### 1. Webpage Translation

- Text nodes are parsed and extracted from the DOM via JavaScript.
- Sent to Gemma 3N for translation with prompt conditioning for context.
- Translated text is reinjected preserving formatting and user experience.

#### 2. Image & Infographic Translation

- ML Kit OCR scans images on the page to extract text and layout information.
- Gemma translates the extracted text.
- JS overlays draw translated text at precise image coordinates.
- Current challenge: maintaining natural visual aesthetics on overlays.

#### 3. YouTube Video Dubbing

- YouTube video transcripts are fetched through available APIs.
- Captions are translated and converted to speech on-device.
- A custom UI button toggles the dubbed audio track.
- Future plans include real-time sync and voiceover improvements.

### Challenges & Learnings

- **Gemma Latency**: Large page translations require prompt length optimization and batching.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Synchronizing multiple simultaneous translation requests to avoid crashes.
- **Feature Isolation**: Restricting active translation modules to conserve memory and improve stability.
- **Image Translation Rendering**: Overlay translation is an ongoing challenge to maintain aesthetics and readability.

## üß© About SmartCookieWeb

[SmartCookieWeb](https://github.com/CookieJarApps/SmartCookieWeb) is an open-source Chromium-based Android web browser designed for extensibility and lightweight performance. PolyNet uses SmartCookieWeb as its base browser to leverage its built-in Chromium rendering engine and customizable architecture, allowing seamless injection and manipulation of webpage content required for advanced translation features.

---

## üî≠ Roadmap & Next Steps

- Optimize batching and prompt size to improve translation speed.
- Enhance subtitle auto-alignment and dubbing synchronization.
- Improve image text translation with layout-aware rendering or inpainting.
- Develop **PolyGlobe Explorer Mode** for seamless bilingual browsing with input/output translation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This project is an experimental prototype. Performance may vary based on device specifications. Testing was primarily done on Pixel 9 Pro; occasional app crashes or slowdowns may occur.

If translation features do not work as expected:

- Try refreshing the page.
- Navigate to a different link and restart the app.
